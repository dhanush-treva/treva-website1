Users are no longer just searching they are conversing with AI engines like Gemini, Perplexity, and ChatGPT. Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the new frontier.',

Citation-Ready Formatting AI prefers structured data. High-density information blocks and clear FAQ schemas make it easy for AI to scrape and credit your website. 3. The Trust Factor (E-E-A-T) Google\'s "Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust" framework is more critical than ever.',
